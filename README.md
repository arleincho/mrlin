# mrlin - MapReduce processing of Linked Data

> ...because it's magic

The basic idea of **mrlin** is to enable **M**ap **R**educe processing of **Lin**ked Data (hence the name). In the following I'm going to show you first to how to use HBase to store Linked Data with RDF and then how to use Hadoop to do execute MapReduce jobs.

## Background

### Dependencies

* You'll need [Apache HBase](http://hbase.apache.org/) first. I downloaded [`hbase-0.94.2.tar.gz`](http://ftp.heanet.ie/mirrors/www.apache.org/dist/hbase/stable/hbase-0.94.2.tar.gz) and then followed the [quickstart](http://hbase.apache.org/book/quickstart.html) up to section 1.2.3.

### Representing RDF triples in HBase
Learn about how mrlin represents [RDF triples in HBase](https://github.com/mhausenblas/mrlin/wiki/RDF-in-HBase).

### RESTful Interaction with HBase
Dig into [RESTful interactions](https://github.com/mhausenblas/mrlin/wiki/RESTful-interaction) with HBase, in mrlin.

## Usage
